# DSA and Applied Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, along with solutions to applied algorithmic problems using **C++**. The aim is to enhance problem-solving skills and strengthen understanding of core algorithms and data structures.

## Objectives
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking, and Graph Algorithms.
- Apply algorithms to solve complex, real-world problems efficiently.
- Optimize time and space complexity through algorithmic thinking.
